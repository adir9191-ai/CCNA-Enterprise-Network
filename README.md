# Enterprise Network Infrastructure – CCNA Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an enterprise-level
network infrastructure using Cisco technologies.

## Network Design
- Multi-router and multi-switch topology
- Segmented network using VLANs
- Redundant default gateways using HSRP

## Technologies & Features
- VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
- Dynamic routing using OSPF
- HSRP for gateway redundancy and failover
- NAT and PAT for internet access
- Standard and Extended ACLs for traffic control
- STP and EtherChannel
- Port Security and SSH for device hardening
- DHCP, DNS, Web Server and Syslog services
- Wireless network integration

## Validation
- Verified end-to-end connectivity between VLANs
- Tested HSRP failover scenarios
- Confirmed ACL enforcement and NAT translation
- Ensured network resilience during device failures
